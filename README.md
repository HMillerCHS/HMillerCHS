- 👋 Hi, I’m @HMillerCHS

- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things because I think one should never stop learning. I am learning Java much better than I ever have because I am teaching it now. I am also and teaching AP Computer Science Principles, Computer Science Principles, and Unity Game Design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Microsoft MakeCode Arcade and physical computing.
